# csv-remove-duplicates-python
A simple Python script developed to identify duplicate references from a CSV and generate a new CSV with no duplicate entries. The script looks at the document title, authors and DOI to identify a duplication. If there is no DOI, the script focuses on the document title and the authors alone.
